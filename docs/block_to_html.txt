Short explanation of the implementation for 'Block to HTML' provided by our friend Boots:

High-level

It parses a full Markdown document into block-level chunks.
It classifies each block (paragraph, heading, code, quote, ordered list, unordered list).
It converts each block into an HTML node tree, handling inline Markdown inside most blocks.
It wraps all block nodes under a single div parent.
Key pieces

BlockType enum
Enumerates six block kinds: paragraph, heading, code, quote, ordered_list, unordered_list.
markdown_to_blocks(markdown)
Splits the raw markdown string into blocks separated by blank lines: split on "\n\n".
Trims whitespace for each block and drops empty ones.
Returns a list of normalized blocks.
block_to_block_type(block)
Determines the block’s type:
Headings: lines starting with 1–6 hashes and a space (e.g., "# ", "## ", ...).
Code blocks: multiple lines where the first and last lines start with ``` (backticks).
Quote blocks: all lines must start with ">".
Unordered lists: all lines must start with "- ".
Ordered lists: lines must start with "1. ", "2. ", ... incrementing by one.
Otherwise, paragraph.
If any line in a supposed list/quote violates the format, it falls back to paragraph.
markdown_to_html_node(markdown)
Orchestrator:
Converts markdown to blocks.
For each block, converts it to an HTML node via block_to_html_node.
Wraps all those as children of a ParentNode("div", children, None).
block_to_html_node(block)
Dispatches by block type to the specific builder:
paragraph_to_html_node
heading_to_html_node
code_to_html_node
olist_to_html_node
ulist_to_html_node
quote_to_html_node
text_to_children(text)
Inline parsing bridge:
Uses text_to_textnodes(text) to produce a list of TextNode objects representing inline markdown (bold, italic, code, links, etc., as implemented elsewhere).
Converts each TextNode into its corresponding HTML node via text_node_to_html_node.
Returns a list of child nodes suitable for embedding inside block nodes.
paragraph_to_html_node(block)
Joins multi-line paragraph blocks with spaces (preserving paragraph semantics).
Parses inline markdown via text_to_children.
Wraps children in ParentNode("p", children).
heading_to_html_node(block)
Counts leading '#' to determine heading level.
Validates that there’s a space and content after the hashes.
Extracts the text after the "# " prefix.
Parses inline markdown in the heading text.
Returns ParentNode(f"h{level}", children).
code_to_html_node(block)
Validates code fence: must start and end with ``` on separate lines.
Extracts the raw text between the fences; importantly, it does not run inline parsing.
Wraps raw text as a text node, then as <code>, then as <pre>:
<pre><code>...raw text...</code></pre>
This matches the lesson’s “no inline parsing inside code blocks” rule.
olist_to_html_node(block)
Splits lines, strips the leading "N. " (three chars) from each line to get item text.
Parses inline markdown inside each item via text_to_children.
Wraps each in <li>, then returns ParentNode("ol", items).
ulist_to_html_node(block)
Similar to ordered list, but strips "- " (two chars).
Parses inline, wraps each in <li>, then returns ParentNode("ul", items).
quote_to_html_node(block)
Validates every line starts with ">".
Strips the leading ">" and surrounding whitespace from each line.
Joins lines with spaces into a single string for the quote’s content.
Parses inline markdown.
Wraps in ParentNode("blockquote", children).
Notable design choices

Inline parsing is centralized via text_to_children, except for code blocks where inline parsing is intentionally skipped.
Multi-line paragraphs and quotes are collapsed into a single line of text separated by spaces, which is suitable for HTML rendering.
Ordered list validation for block detection requires strictly increasing numeric prefixes starting at 1 when identifying the block type, but during HTML generation it assumes already-validated lines and simply slices off the marker.
This structure aligns with the tests in the lesson:

Div root containing block-level nodes.
Inline parsing inside paragraphs and headings, but not inside fenced code.
Correct tag mapping for quotes, lists, and headings.


Example:

Input markdown:

# Title

This is **bold** and `code`.

- Item one
- Item two


code block no inline


> A quote
> across lines

Step 1: markdown_to_blocks

Split on blank lines and strip:
"# Title"
"This is bold and code."
"- Item one\n- Item two"
"\ncode block _no_ inline\n"
"> A quote\n> across lines"
Step 2: block_to_block_type per block

"# Title" → HEADING (starts with "# ")
paragraph text → PARAGRAPH
lines all start with "- " → ULIST
first and last lines start with ``` → CODE
all lines start with ">" → QUOTE
Step 3: markdown_to_html_node orchestrates

For each block, call block_to_html_node and collect children under ParentNode("div", children).
Step 4: block_to_html_node details

Heading: "# Title"

heading_to_html_node
Count hashes: level=1
Text after "# " → "Title"
text_to_children("Title") → [TextNode(TEXT,"Title")] → [HTML text node]
ParentNode("h1", [text node])
Paragraph: "This is bold and code."

paragraph_to_html_node
Single line, so paragraph text is unchanged
text_to_children parses inline:
"This is " → text
"bold" → bold
" and " → text
"code" → inline code
"." → text
Convert each TextNode → corresponding HTML child nodes: text, <b>, text, <code>, text
ParentNode("p", [children])
Unordered list:

ulist_to_html_node
Split lines:
"- Item one" → strip first 2 chars → "Item one"
"- Item two" → "Item two"
For each item:
text_to_children on string
Wrap in ParentNode("li", children)
Wrap list: ParentNode("ul", [li1, li2])
Code block:

code_to_html_node
Validate fences
Extract text = block[4:-3] → "code block no inline\n"
Note: no inline parsing here
Make raw TextNode(TEXT, text) → text_node_to_html_node → text node
Wrap: ParentNode("code", [text]) → ParentNode("pre", [code])
Quote:

quote_to_html_node
Validate each line starts with ">"
Strip leading ">" and surrounding spaces:
"A quote"
"across lines"
Join with spaces → "A quote across lines"
Inline parse via text_to_children (no special markup here)
ParentNode("blockquote", [text child])
Step 5: Wrap all children

ParentNode("div", [h1, p, ul, pre, blockquote])
Final HTML (to_html):
<div><h1>Title</h1><p>This is <b>bold</b> and <code>code</code>.</p><ul><li>Item one</li><li>Item two</li></ul><pre><code>code block no inline
</code></pre><blockquote>A quote across lines</blockquote></div>
