If an error is being thrown when creating the html files from the markdown, dele the ".DS_Store" files.. run command:
find . -name ".DS_Store" - delete

this finds and deletes all files that match the name in the current directory tree





If there is an error where the server gets stuck and doesn't allow to run the program:
run command:
ps -a

locate the PID for the http.server 8888  process
run command:
kill -9 *PID*
